# Geography
Geography: Derived from two Greek words: "geo" (the Earth), "graphein" (to write).
Geographers, find answer for two types of questions:
1.	Where are things?
2.	Why are things there where they are?
Why questions are more challenging because every answer generates a new series of why questions.
Geography is often referred as a spatial science concerned with the use of earth surface
Defined as the study of spatial variation - how and why physical and cultural features differ from place to place
Geographers also study how observable spatial patterns evolved through time temporal changes
Sub-fields of Geo: Human, Physical, Techniques
Human Geography: Concerned with understanding places, regions and spatial relationships as a series of interrelated forces stemming from nature, culture and human action.
1.	Human <-> environment interaction
2.	Distribution of human activities
There are eight branches of human geo.

# Fundamental Concepts
## Location
Location is nominal, or expressed solely in terms of the names given to regions and places
Absolute location (Latitude and longitude)
Relative location (China town in Vancouver)
Cognitive location (mental maps)
Latitude (Parallel): refers to the angular distance of a point on the Earth's surface, measured in degrees, minutes and seconds north or south of the equator.
Longitude (Meridian): refers to the angular distance of a point on the Earth's surface, measured in degrees, minutes and seconds east or west from the prime meridian

## Distance
Can be an absolute physical measure, whose units may be in kms or miles, and as a relative measure, expressed in terms of time and cost
Absolute distance (physical distance)
Relative distance (time and cost)
Cognitive distance (perceived)
First Law of Geography: The Friction of Distance: Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.
Distance Decay: The rate at which a particular activity or process diminishes with increasing distance.

## Space
Like distance, space can be measured in absolute, relative and cognitive terms
Absolute space: physical space or mathematical space which can be measured mathematically
described through points, lines and areas
different patterns (rectangular, square, circular)
3 Types of Space.
Socio-Economic Space: described in terms of socio-economic conditions and distribution patterns dividing the world into economic blocks such as G-8 or G-20
Cultural Space: is the space of groups of people with common ties whose attributes carry special meaning for a particular group
Cognitive Space: measured in terms of peoples values, feelings, beliefs and perceptions landmarks, paths, environments, etc.

## Place
A place is a concept with two levels of meaning:
a)	an objective location that has both uniqueness and interdependent relations with other places
b)	A subjective social and cultural construct has personal meaning for individuals or groups
The Canadian author Richler once described Canada as better known for its spaces rather than its places

## Region
Refers to a larger-sized territory that encompasses many places, all or most of which share similar attributes;
a)	Physical attributes example: the Canadian Shield
b)	Cultural attributes example: the Canadian region of Canada
There are 3 types of Regions;
a.	Vernacular region generally accepted within a community, more subjective and boundaries are poorly defined (example: the Lower Mainland)
b.	Formal region based on one or at most a few criteria, the most objective and well-defined (examples: British Columbia as a formal political region, or the Coast Mountains, a formal physiographic region based on landforms and geology)
a.	Functional region more complex, intended to function as a system or network, typically with both objective and subjective elements (example: the temperate rain forest biome a combination of climate, vegetation and soil, including their interactions, within a functional physical region)

## Accessibility
The opportunity for contact or interaction from a given point or location in relation to other locations
Implies proximity, or nearness to something (channels: road, telephone, wavebands)
Distance is one aspect of accessibility.
Function of economic, cultural and social factors (example: access to services, cost, and cultural barriers).

## Spatial Interaction
Interdependence between places and regions through movement and flows of goods and services Examples: freight shipments, commuting, shopping trips, telecommunications, electronic cash transfers, migration, vacation trips.
There are 4 contributing factors of spatial interaction.
a.	Complementarity: a precondition for interdependence between places (example: oil in Arab countries, vacation to Mexico in winter time)
b.	Transferability: cost of transportation and ability to recover this cost
c.	Intervening opportunity: alternative origins or destinations (less expensive and quick access)
a.	Spatial diffusion: the way things spread through space and over time. The movement (flow) of goods, innovations and ideas, services and people from one location to another
There are 2 types of Spatial Diffusion;
a)	Relocation diffusion: an item leave original area behind as it moves to a new area e.g. migration. People move to new area and take their culture (e.g. language, religion) with them, as in the case of East Indian population in Surrey, or the Chinese population in Richmond
b)	Expansion diffusion: Items spread geographically by passing from one person to another while remaining with the first person Example: the movement of AIDS around the world, and the historic waves of smallpox epidemics and their impact on First Nations; or the spread of high speed internet service
For spatial diffusion the contagious effect states that places near the origin are usually affected first
a)	The farther you are from the point of origin, the later you will be affected (the process is strongly influenced by distance because you are more likely to come in contact with nearby persons than with more remote persons)
b)	Spread of Islam from its birthplace in Mecca in what is now Saudi Arabia is a good example of contagious diffusion.

## Scale
Scale: Level of analysis Local, regional, national, global
Map Scale: refers to the ratio between linear distance on a map and linear distance on Earths surface
Large scale vs. Small scale maps
A large scale map shows greater detail, small features can be seen, covers smaller area (e.g. 1: 10,000).
A small scale map shows less detail, only large features can be seen,   covers larger area  (e.g. 1: 250,000).
Scale Representation on the Map
Representative fraction:1:100,000, 1 to 100,000, or 1/100,000
Verbal: 1 inch = 50 miles
Graphic: Scale bar |----10 miles ---|

# The Changing Global Context
## The Changing World
Places and regions interact with each other - their relationship/dependency changes over time
Sequence of changes has not been the same everywhere
Best way to understand these changes by thinking the world as an evolving political-economic system

## World System
An interdependent system of countries linked by economic and political competition
Modern world-system had its origin in 15th century after the exploration of other countries by Europeans
Innovation of technology - ship building and navigation - connected more places and regions through trade
More people became exposed to one another's technologies and ideas
Different resources, social structure and cultural systems resulted in different pathways of development
Today, there exists a highly structured relationship between places and regions
This relationship is organized around three tiers:
1. Core regions (countries)
    1. Control most advanced technologies
    2. Dominate trade
    3. High levels of productivity within diversified economies
    4. High per capita income
2. Semiperipheral regions (countries)
3. Peripheral regions (countries)

Core Regions:
The success of the core regions depends on their dominance and exploitation of other regions
Initially this was achieved by military enforcement, then by European colonialism, and finally by economic and political influence of the core regions

Peripheral Regions:
Obsolete technologies
Low levels of productivity
Undeveloped or narrowly specialized economies
Dependent or disadvantageous trading relationships
Low per capita income

Semiperipheral Regions:
In between core regions and peripheral regions are semiperipheral regions
Able to exploit peripheral regions, but are them-selves exploited and dominated by core regions
They consist mostly of countries that were once peripheral

Where is Canada's position? Canada is simultaneously part of the global core and semiperiphery
Per Capita GNP is high
Member of G8 group of nations
Large parts of the Canadian economy are American-owned  Canada has less influence

## Development of Mini-systems
Before the origin of the modern world-system, there were many mini-systems around the world
Mini-system: a society with a single cultural base and a reciprocal social economy
Each clan/group specializes in particular tasks and freely giving any excess product to others  exchange of goods and services
First agricultural revolution was a transition from hunter-gatherer mini-systems to agricultural-based mini-systems - began in early Stone Age period (9,000 - 7,000 B.C.)
Transition was based on a series of technological breakthroughs - use of fire to process food,  grindstones to mill grains, and tools to prepare and store food
One key breakthrough was the evolution and diffusion of a system of slash-and-burn agriculture
Slash-and-burn Agriculture: A system of cultivation in which plants are cropped close to ground, left to dry for a period, and then ignited

## The Growth of World Empires
Higher population densities, changes in social organization, and trade brought by first agricultural revolution, provided the preconditions for the emergence of several world-empires
A world-empire is a group of mini-systems that have been absorbed into a common political system while retaining their fundamental cultural differences
Some of the best world-empires Egypt, Greece, China and Rome
World empires brought two important elements to the evolution of the worlds geographies:
* Emergence of urbanization (towns and cities became essential as centres of administration, military garrisons, and theological centres for the ruling classes)
* Second contribution was colonization

## Geography of the Pre-modern World
Other important world-empires were based in Southeast Asia, North, East and West Africa, and in Europe
These regions were interconnected through trade, which meant that several emerging centers of capitalism existed
Several port cities were established such as Venice, Cairo, Calicut, Canton, Malacca and Sofala

## European Based World System
Although the Chinese civilization was very developed in terms of science, technology and navigation, it was European merchant capitalism that reshaped the world
Several factors motivated European overseas expansion:
* A relatively higher population density
* Limited amount of cultivable land and food resources
* Innovations in shipbuilding, navigation and gunnery

## Industrialization and Geographic Change
With new production and transportation technologies of the industrial revolution (late 18th C), capitalism became a global system and reached every part of the world
New production technologies - based on more concentrated forms of energy, such as coal - helped raise levels of productivity and created new and better products -  stimulated demand, increased profit, and created a pool of capital for further investment
Improvements in transportation system helped geographic expansion through exercise of military power

## Industrialization in Europe
In Europe, industrialization occurred in three distinctive waves:
* Between 1790-1850: based on the initial cluster of industrial technologies (steam engines, cotton textiles and iron working) and was very localized
* Between 1850-1870: involved the diffusion of industrialization to most of the rest of Britain and to parts of northwest Europe (France, Belgium and Germany)
    * New technologies steel, machine tools, railroads and steamships

Between 1870-1914: innovation of technologies such as electricity, electrical engineering and telecommunications  created new opportunities
* During this period, industrialization spread to remote parts of Britain, France and Germany and other countries such as Netherlands, Italy, Austria and Spain

## Industrialization in USA
By the end of 19th century, the core of the world system had extended to USA and Japan
USA, which was under peripheral group, was able to make the move to core because of following factors:
* Vast natural resources that provided raw materials for a variety of industries
* No political dispute because of its boundaries
* Its population, growing quickly through immigration helped carry the industrial activities
* Cultural and trading links with Europe provided business contacts, technological know-how, and access to capital for investment in basic infrastructure such as canals, railways, warehouses and factories

## Major Change in the World-System
The world-system began to disintegrate shortly after the World War II
USA emerged as the new hegemonic power - dominant state within the world-system core
This core came to be called the First World
Soviet Union and China, opting for alternative paths of development for themselves and their satellite countries, were seen as a Second World

## Decolonization
By the 1950s, many of the old European colonies began to seek political independence
Some of the early independence struggles were very bloody as the colonial powers were initially reluctant to withdraw from colonies
However, by the early 1960s, the process of decolonization became relatively smooth
The periphery of the world-system now consisted of a Third World of politically independent states

# Geographies of Population
## Sources of Population Data
Census:  Source of demographic data
* Population (total population, age, sex, marital status, levels of education, occupation, Citizenship and ethnic origin, previous residence, other  personal data)
* Housing, health, employment

Census in Canada (Statistics Canada):
* Past Census Years  1956, 1966, 1976, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016
* Next Census  2021
* Expensive & time consuming - $700 million (2016)

## World Population
World population reached 7 billion on October 31, 2011
Global Population Today  7.5 billion
Expected to reach 10 billion ~ 2050
Where are populations concentrated?

## Core Demographic Concepts
1. Population Density
2. Age-Sex Pyramid
3. Dependency Ratio
4. Fertility
5. Mortality
6. Mobility

## Population Density
 Crude Density (Arithmetic density):
Total number of people divided by the total land area (# of people per sq. km.)

Total Land Area of Canada  8,965,121 km2
Total Population of Canada - 33,476,688 (2011)

Population density of Canada?
Nutritional Density:
Ratio between total population and amount of land under cultivation in a given unit of area
	(# of people per sq. km. of land under cultivation)

Total Agricultural Land in Canada  675,867 km2
Total Population of Canada - 33,476,688 (2011)

Nutritional density of Canada?


Contributing Factors to Uneven Distribution of Population
Physical Factors:
Religious/Cultural Factors:

## Age-Sex Pyramid
A representation of the population based on its composition according to age and sex
* a bar graph displayed horizontally
* male portrayed on the left, female on right
* youngest at the bottom, oldest on the top

Helps identify changes in the age and sex  composition of populations

## Dependency Ratio
		
* a measure of the economic impact of the young and old on the more economically productive members of the population
* demographers divide the entire population into three age groups or cohorts:
    * Youth cohort (<15 years of age)
    * Middle cohort (15-64 age group)
    * Old-age cohort (>64)

## Population Dynamics and Processes
What are the three most important factors that contribute towards population growth or change of a country or region?

### Crude Birth or Fertility Rate:
the ratio of the number of live births in a single year for every thousand people in the population

live births                  X 1000
  people in the population

### Crude Death or Mortality Rate:
the number of deaths in a single year for every thousand people in the population

deaths                  X 1000
  people in the population

### Fertility:
Childbearing performance of individuals, couples, groups, or populations


Total Fertility Rate (TFR):
Average number of children a woman will have throughout the years that demographers have identified as her childbearing years, approximately ages 15-49

### Natural Increase:
The difference between the CBR and the CDR, which is the surplus of births over deaths


Infant Mortality Rate:
The annual number of deaths of infants under one year of age compared with the total number of live births for that same year

## World Population Distribution
Generally speaking:
high birth rates (BR) and high death rates (DR) characterize countries in the periphery
Why?

Generally speaking:
low BR and low DR countries in the core areas of the world
Why?

## Population Movement and Migration
Migration: a long-distance move to a new location
International migration: a move from one country to another
Internal migration: a move within a particular country or region

### Factors Encourage Migration
Push Factors:
Events and condition that impel an individual to move away from a location
Examples: poor amenities, war, economic dislocation, ecological deterioration, etc.

Pull Factors:
Forces of attraction that influence migrants to move to a particular location
Examples: better amenities, better economic opportunities

Types of Migration:
Voluntary Migration:
The movement by an individual based on choice

Forced Migration:
The movement by an individual against his or her will (refugees in Bhutan-Nepal border)

Eco-Migration: (environmental refugees)
A population movement caused by the degradation of land and essential natural resources (ghost towns)

## Population Policies and Programs
### Initiatives at International Level
Recent concerns about the ever increasing global population have led to the development of international and national policies and programs
UN has been sponsoring international conferences in every 10 years to develop population policies at the global level
Each conference provides policy guidelines in order to lowering fertility rates in periphery and semiperiphery regions

### Core vs. Peripheral Countries
1974 Conference  core countries suggested family planning, periphery countries suggested economic development
1984 Conference  core countries advocated economic development, periphery countries suggested family planning

### Initiatives at International LevelCairo, 1994

Areas of emphasis:
1. recognizing dropping of the fertility rates both in the core and periphery countries
2. reduction of poverty and disease
3. improved educational opportunities for girls and women
4. promote environmentally sustainable development

Cairo Conference was first among the three where both core and peripheral countries agreed on a single plan to achieve:
1. population stabilization
2. a plan that would encourage freedom of choice in the matter of family size
3. population policy and program, and
4. development policy and practice

Cairo Conference recognized that the history, social and cultural practices, development levels and goals, and political structures are different for each country
Therefore, a rigid and uniform policy to limit fertility rate will not work for all countries
Where some programs and approaches will be effective for some countries, they will be fruitless for others

Examples:

Chinas One-Child Policy
Appears successful, but little data is available for the entire country
Bias towards urban areas
Concerns over female infanticide

Indias Family Planning Program
Free contraceptives and counseling
Similar concerns over female infanticide

Sri Lanka, Thailand and Cuba
These countries were able to lower the fertility rate not through regulation of family size, but by establishing greater access to social resources, such as health care and education, particularly for women

### Other Policy Initiatives
Demographers find that a close-relationship exists between womens status and fertility
Women who are educated and having a job tend to have fewer children because they have less of a need for economic security and social recognition that children are thought to provide

Examples:

Botswana 
With no education women have 5.9 kids on average 
With 4-6 years education have 3.1 kids on average

Senegal
With no education women have 7 kids on average
With 10 years education number of children drops to 3.6 children on average

These numbers are comparable for Asia and South American countries

# Agriculture and Food Production
## What do you mean by agriculture?
Agriculture is considered as a science, an art, and a business directed at the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock for sustenance and profit
1. growing of crops
2. raising livestock

## Pre-agricultural Activities
Before humans realized the benefits from agriculture, they procured their food through hunting and gathering
Hunting and gathering are considered subsistence activities because people who practice them procure only what they need to consume

## Subsistence Agriculture
Malnutrition, disease and hardship characterized the lives of hunter-gatherers
Subsistence agriculture replaced hunting and gathering when people understood that the domestication of plants and animals could enable them to remain settled in one place
Subsistence agriculture refers to farming for direct consumption by the producers, not for sale

Types of Subsistence Agriculture;
Worldwide, the practice of subsistence agriculture is diminishing - still widely practiced in some of the peripheral countries

Dominant forms of Subsistence agriculture are:
    1. Shifting cultivation (slash-and-burn agriculture)
    2. Intensive subsistence agriculture
    3. Pastoralism

## Shifting Cultivation
	A system in which farmers aim to maintain soil fertility by rotating the fields within which cultivation occurs

Popular in tropical countries:
Central and West Africa
Amazon in South America
Southeast Asia (Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia and Indonesia)

Less expensive compared to modern agriculture

Support only small population

### Methods of Shifting Cultivation
Typical method for preparing land is through slash-and-burn, in which existing plants are cropped close to the ground, left to dry for a period, and then fired
The burning process adds valuable nutrients such as potash to the soil
Once the land is cleared and ready for cultivation, it is known as swidden
Relies purely on human labour  no plow

### Impacts of Shifting Cultivation
Advantages
Less expensive
Good for fragile landscapes
Does not require special skills
Both men and women get job
Less impact on environment

Disadvantages
Production is low
Requires extensive land
Not suitable for large population
Sites are located far from villages  wastage of energy

### Intensive Subsistence Agriculture
Population growth and greater need for increased outputs led to development of more intensive forms of agriculture
Practice that involves a considerable expenditure of human labour and application of fertilizer in order to maximize yield from a small parcel of land

### Characteristics of Intensive Subsistence Agriculture
Supports large rural population
Higher agricultural densities
Popular in Asia (India, China, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam)

## Pastoralism
involves breeding and herding of animals to satisfy human needs of food, shelter and clothing
Practiced in the cold and dry climates of deserts, savannas and steppes

Types of Pastoralism:
1. Sedentary:(pastoralists live in settlements and herd animals in nearby pastures)
2. Nomadic:(move with herds over long distances and never settling in any place for long)

## Agricultural Revolutions
Geographers and other scholars have divided the history of world agriculture into three distinct revolutionary periods:
First Agricultural Revolution
* Between 10-15 thousand years ago
* Use of plow and draft animals
* Development of seed agriculture
* Domestication of plants and animals

Second Agricultural Revolution
* Demand for food from a growing urban and industrial population
* Improvement in livestock and crop yields
* Replacement of ox by horse
* Introduction of new crops (potato and turnip)
* New inputs in agricultural production (application of fertilizer and field drainage system)

### Impacts of Second Agricultural Revolution
Soil erosion
Desertification of land
Water pollution
Mechanization

Third Agricultural Revolution
* (Started around late 19th Century)
* Started in the late 19th century and gained momentum throughout the 20th century
* Originated first in North America and then spread to other parts of the world
* Agricultural practices were mainly driven by technological innovations and industrialization
Main aspects of the 3rd agricultural revolution were:
* Mechanization (replacement of manual labour by machines)
* Chemical farming with synthetic fertilizers
* Globally widespread food manufacturing (adding economic value to agricultural products)

### The Green Revolution
Export of a technological package of fertilizer and high-yielding seed, from core to periphery, to increase global agricultural productivity
* Started in late 1960s in peripheral countries      (Asia and Mexico)
* Also termed as chemical farming
High yield variety seed
Heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides
Wide use of machines such as tractors
Consume more energy

Positive Impacts
* Agricultural production of selected crops such as rice and wheat increased many folds
* Many developing countries such as India, China and Sri Lanka became self-reliant in food production
* Helped mitigate hunger from many peripheral countries

Negative Impacts
* Suitable for resourceful regions
* More capital-intensive  buying of inputs
* Indebtedness increased for small-scale producers
* Mechanization takes over manual labour
* Dominance of corporate farmers
* Small-scale farmers have to compete with large farms
* Increased environmental pollution

### Development of Agriculture in Canada
Most of Canadas productive agricultural land lies within 200 km of the American border
Limiting factors?
Share of agricultural farmland to total land area in the country is around 7%

#### Agriculture in Canadian LifeRecent Developments
Statistics show that the farming economy has been under attack for the last 50-60 years
Total number of farms has declined sharply
Total number of farmers also declined
Canadian agriculture is in a precarious state

Factors Contributing towards this Change:
Farm Polarization:
* In an increasing global market, many family farms are too small to compete to large farm
* Large farms taking advantage of economies of scale  today only 5% of farms produce half of Canadas total agricultural output

Subsidies:
* Pressure from WTO and NAFTA to eliminate domestic subsidies
* Decline farm income  25 years ago, more than 1/3rd of income came from government subsidies  today that share is about 14%

The Cash Squeeze: 
* Price of agricultural inputs (fertilizer, pesticides, seed, machinery, land, labour, financing) has gone up significantly  from 1974 to 1994 farm operating cost rose by 40%)

Demographics:
* Canadas farming population is aging
* Half of all farm operators are older than 55 years of age
* Fewer younger people are interested in farming
* Already half of all farmers have to seek off-farm employment to make ends meet  20% only work full-time

#### Opportunities Ahead for Canadas Agricultural Sector
Throughout 1990s and early part of 21st century, Canadian farmers were struggling
At present, there are some opportunities particularly for Prairie grain producers
Increasing demand for food products worldwide  farming now profitable
Increasing demand for grains from India and China
Increasing middle class people in India and China
* Rising demand for more nutritious food
* Willing to pay more towards buying food
* Milk is the new oil
Increasing demand from ethanol producers:
* Ethanol production uses 20% of American corn harvest
* Diversion of cereals such as corn into biofuel production
* Lead to production of more cereals/corn
* Price of farmland in Saskatchewan has gone up by 15%
Increasing effects of climate Change:
* Decline in grain production from Prairies due to a series of droughts in recent years
* Lead to increase in price for grains to meet demand from India and China

##### Possible Options for the Future
Increasing the cost of food
* (Canadians spend less than 10% of their income on food  less than spending on communications  TV, internet and cell phones  good for consumers, not for farmers)
Encouraging farmers to develop forms of food processing
* Encourage to sell more value added products

Promoting more organic farming
* Ever increasing demand for organic products/food
* Currently only 1% of farms in Canada produce organic crops
* Demand for organic products is much higher than the supply

Supporting city-oriented farmers markets and delivery
* Contract with a group of individuals to deliver food products throughout the year
* Consumer satisfaction  know the source of the food and conditions of growing the crops
* A trend very popular in Toronto and Montreal
