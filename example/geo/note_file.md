# Geography
Geography: Derived from two Greek words: "geo" (the Earth), "graphein" (to write).
Geographers, find answer for two types of questions:
1.	Where are things?
2.	Why are things there where they are?
Why questions are more challenging because every answer generates a new series of why questions.
Geography is often referred as a spatial science concerned with the use of earth surface
Defined as the study of spatial variation - how and why physical and cultural features differ from place to place
Geographers also study how observable spatial patterns evolved through time temporal changes
Sub-fields of Geo: Human, Physical, Techniques
Human Geography: Concerned with understanding places, regions and spatial relationships as a series of interrelated forces stemming from nature, culture and human action.
1.	Human <-> environment interaction
2.	Distribution of human activities
There are eight branches of human geo.

# Fundamental Concepts
## Location
Location is nominal, or expressed solely in terms of the names given to regions and places
Absolute location (Latitude and longitude)
Relative location (China town in Vancouver)
Cognitive location (mental maps)
Latitude (Parallel): refers to the angular distance of a point on the Earth's surface, measured in degrees, minutes and seconds north or south of the equator.
Longitude (Meridian): refers to the angular distance of a point on the Earth's surface, measured in degrees, minutes and seconds east or west from the prime meridian

## Distance
Can be an absolute physical measure, whose units may be in kms or miles, and as a relative measure, expressed in terms of time and cost
Absolute distance (physical distance)
Relative distance (time and cost)
Cognitive distance (perceived)
First Law of Geography: The Friction of Distance: Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.
Distance Decay: The rate at which a particular activity or process diminishes with increasing distance.

## Space
Like distance, space can be measured in absolute, relative and cognitive terms
Absolute space: physical space or mathematical space which can be measured mathematically
described through points, lines and areas
different patterns (rectangular, square, circular)
3 Types of Space.
Socio-Economic Space: described in terms of socio-economic conditions and distribution patterns dividing the world into economic blocks such as G-8 or G-20
Cultural Space: is the space of groups of people with common ties whose attributes carry special meaning for a particular group
Cognitive Space: measured in terms of peoples values, feelings, beliefs and perceptions landmarks, paths, environments, etc.

## Place
A place is a concept with two levels of meaning:
a)	an objective location that has both uniqueness and interdependent relations with other places
b)	A subjective social and cultural construct has personal meaning for individuals or groups
The Canadian author Richler once described Canada as better known for its spaces rather than its places

## Region
Refers to a larger-sized territory that encompasses many places, all or most of which share similar attributes;
a)	Physical attributes example: the Canadian Shield
b)	Cultural attributes example: the Canadian region of Canada
There are 3 types of Regions;
a.	Vernacular region generally accepted within a community, more subjective and boundaries are poorly defined (example: the Lower Mainland)
b.	Formal region based on one or at most a few criteria, the most objective and well-defined (examples: British Columbia as a formal political region, or the Coast Mountains, a formal physiographic region based on landforms and geology)
a.	Functional region more complex, intended to function as a system or network, typically with both objective and subjective elements (example: the temperate rain forest biome a combination of climate, vegetation and soil, including their interactions, within a functional physical region)

## Accessibility
The opportunity for contact or interaction from a given point or location in relation to other locations
Implies proximity, or nearness to something (channels: road, telephone, wavebands)
Distance is one aspect of accessibility.
Function of economic, cultural and social factors (example: access to services, cost, and cultural barriers).

## Spatial Interaction
Interdependence between places and regions through movement and flows of goods and services Examples: freight shipments, commuting, shopping trips, telecommunications, electronic cash transfers, migration, vacation trips.
There are 4 contributing factors of spatial interaction.
a.	Complementarity: a precondition for interdependence between places (example: oil in Arab countries, vacation to Mexico in winter time)
b.	Transferability: cost of transportation and ability to recover this cost
c.	Intervening opportunity: alternative origins or destinations (less expensive and quick access)
a.	Spatial diffusion: the way things spread through space and over time. The movement (flow) of goods, innovations and ideas, services and people from one location to another
There are 2 types of Spatial Diffusion;
a)	Relocation diffusion: an item leave original area behind as it moves to a new area e.g. migration. People move to new area and take their culture (e.g. language, religion) with them, as in the case of East Indian population in Surrey, or the Chinese population in Richmond
b)	Expansion diffusion: Items spread geographically by passing from one person to another while remaining with the first person Example: the movement of AIDS around the world, and the historic waves of smallpox epidemics and their impact on First Nations; or the spread of high speed internet service
For spatial diffusion the contagious effect states that places near the origin are usually affected first
a)	The farther you are from the point of origin, the later you will be affected (the process is strongly influenced by distance because you are more likely to come in contact with nearby persons than with more remote persons)
b)	Spread of Islam from its birthplace in Mecca in what is now Saudi Arabia is a good example of contagious diffusion.

## Scale
Scale: Level of analysis Local, regional, national, global
Map Scale: refers to the ratio between linear distance on a map and linear distance on Earths surface
Large scale vs. Small scale maps
A large scale map shows greater detail, small features can be seen, covers smaller area (e.g. 1: 10,000).
A small scale map shows less detail, only large features can be seen,   covers larger area  (e.g. 1: 250,000).
Scale Representation on the Map
Representative fraction:1:100,000, 1 to 100,000, or 1/100,000
Verbal: 1 inch = 50 miles
Graphic: Scale bar |----10 miles ---|

# Methods in Human Geography
## Quantitative Methods
Emphasize objective measurements and the statistical, mathematical, or numerical analysis of data collected through polls, questionnaires, and surveys, or by manipulating pre-existing statistical data using computational techniques.
